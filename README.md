# WatchLaterDuration

This project uses Selenium to log in to a YouTube account of your choice.

Your account can be added directly in the program, which will then be stored in a 'constants.py' file for 
later use.

The program will then log in to the account, navigate to the Watch Later playlist, do some not-so-fancy math
and determine the amount of time and videos in the playlist.
